## Project Overview

This project is a responsive landing page for a headphones brand created as part of the ALX Front-End Software Engineering program. It focuses on solid front-end fundamentals using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **vanilla JavaScript**, with emphasis on:

- Mobile-first responsive design  
- Clean, semantic, and maintainable code  
- Smooth animations and interactive UI elements  
- Use of CSS variables and reset for consistent styling  
- A hamburger menu for small screens (≤480px)  

Each version (from `0-index.html` through `8-index.html`) progressively builds the page with new sections, styles, and functionality.
